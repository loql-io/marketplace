                  Our local communities are much more than simple collections of
                  homes. They are our support networks. Our culture and our
                  heritage. But most of all they are the fabric that hold us
                  together as a people.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                  But these most vital of fabrics are under threat. Local retail
                  and hospitality businesses, the beating heart of our towns and
                  villages, face unprecedented competition from global
                  technology platforms. Our streets are filled with delivery
                  vehicles bringing the convenience of online ordering to our
                  doors but polluting our air as they do. And our local hubs sit
                  dormant as people shun the pain of parking their cars in
                  favour of working or shopping from home.

                  By coming together, local people and businesses have a chance
                  to tackle these economic and environmental threats. And that’s
                  where Loql comes in.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                  We build online marketplaces where local businesses can easily
                  sell their products or services to local people at low cost
                  and without losing control over how their business runs. Very
                  soon they will also have access to a pool of electric delivery
                  vehicles so orders reach customers in as quick and
                  eco-friendly way as possible.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                  We’re also working to help people move locally in a more
                  sustainble way with a fleet of electric vehicles based in town
                  centres and at rail stations that locals can lease.
